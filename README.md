Hello World

Read about and Rate this app!
This is a starter Glitch app for React! It uses only a few dependencies to get you started on working with state handling via Redux:

express - middleware for the node server
react - for generating the views of the app
react-dom - powers the rendering of elements to the DOM, typically paired with React
webpack - for bundling all the javascript
webpack-cli - command line support for webpack
jsx-loader - allows webpack to load jsx files
react-router-dom - handles routing!
redux - handles state!
react-redux - react bindings for using redux
Look in app/components/ for 5 example components:

HelloWorld - which is the view you are seeing now
UnorderedList - which takes an array of "items" and returns a <ul> element with <li>, elements of each of those items within it
About - text content to show when "about" route is accessed
VoteButtons - buttons to rate the app up or down
VoteContainer - container that connects the redux state to the VoteButtons component so you can see total score and count updated
